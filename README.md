This project predicts the **magnitude of an earthquake** using machine learning based on seismic and geophysical data. It also classifies the **risk level** based on the predicted magnitude.

---

## 🔧 What It Does

- Takes input features like **latitude, longitude, depth, stations, gap, RMS, etc.**
- Predicts **earthquake magnitude** using a trained Random Forest model
- Classifies the result into **risk levels** (e.g., Low Risk, High Risk)

---

## 🧠 Model

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- Trained and saved as `earthquake_model.pkl`
